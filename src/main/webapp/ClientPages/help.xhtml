						<div>
							<h3 id="header_help">The header</h3>
							<img class="thumbnail" src="http://placehold.it/850x350" />
							<p>The header is a really important component of our website. It is divided in two parts. On the left part, you can click on... :
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Our logo:</strong> at any time during the visit, it'll take you back to the <a href="#index_help">homepage</a>.</li>
									<li><strong>Browse:</strong> This opens a dropdown menu from where you can choose different options. You can see our entire inventory, or browse our inventory either by genre or by format (EPUB, MOBI, PDF...).</li>
									<li><strong>My books:</strong> This takes you to the <a href="#mybooks_help">"My books" page</a>.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>On the right part, try out these... :
								<ul>
									<li><strong>The search field:</strong> You can search what you want in our inventory depending on a book's title, an author's name, or even a book's ISBN number. It will take you directly to the <a href="#product_help">product's page</a> if there's a single result to your search, or it will <a href="#results_help">lists all the results</a> if there's more than one.</li>
									<li><strong>Help button:</strong> How did you think you got here?</li>
									<li><strong>Shopping cart:</strong> Click it and you'll be able to see what's in your <a href="#cart_help">cart</a>.</li>
									<li><strong>Login/Logout/Register:</strong> If you're not logged in, use that button to log in. <a href="#login_help">The login form</a> will appear. If you're logged in, the button changes to <strong>Logout</strong> and clicking it will <strong>redirect</strong> you to the homepage. If you don't have an account, you should make one by clicking <a href="#register_help">Register</a>.</li>
									<li><strong>EN/FR:</strong> As we use internationalization, you are able to switch the website's language from English to French. What comes from  our database is not translated though :'(</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>Notice how the header follows you when you scroll down our pages ;) You don't have to go all the way up to make another search or to login, etc. Pretty convenient, right?!</p><br />
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 id="footer_help">The footer</h3>
							<img class="thumbnail" src="http://placehold.it/850x350" />

								<ul>
									<li>Bibuli's logo and the headquarters' adress.</li>
									<li>Bibuli's team.</li>
									<li>And some basic footer links and social stuff which don't do anything ;)</li>
